Klipper provides a unique and powerful set of capabilities on top of the existing firmware. Klipper's advanced features include: G-code macros: Klipper can execute G-code macros, used for simplifying complex or repetitive tasks, and to create custom G-code programs for specific tasks. Variable layer heights: Klipper can dynamically adjust layer heights, allowing for better quality prints. Customizable printer settings: Klipper allows for customizing various printer settings, such as maximum acceleration, jerk, and Z-axis height. Enhanced bed leveling: Klipper's bed leveling routines are more sophisticated than the ones typically found in firmware, allowing for better print quality. Installation There are multiple ways to install and setup Klipper. For this tutorial, a tool called Kiauh is used. It is also assumed that a raspberry pi is used. Requirements A Raspberry Pi or other linux machine that is connected to the printer via USB Step 1 - Cloning the installation tool SSH into your raspberry pi and clone Kiauh with the following commands. cd ~ git clone https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh.git Run it with ./kiauh/kiauh.sh Step 2 - Software installation Follow the instructions on the interface to install the following in this order: Klipper Moonraker Mainsail or Fluidd (Both are good choices, but Fluidd will be used for the rest of the tutorial ) Step 3 - Building the firmware Back out into the main menu, and then navigate to \"Advanced\". Choose the option \"Build only\" and follow the instructions for your printer if applicable, or find the architecture information online Elegoo Neptune 3 Config by JerryNGM Micro-controller Architecture (STMicroelectronics STM32) Processor model (STM32F401) Bootloader offset (32KiB bootloader) Communication interface (Serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9)) Step 4 - Firmware installation The tool will output a firmware file. Install this firmware accordingly with your printers instructions. Elegoo Neptune 3 Note. This firmware currently does not utilize the Neptune 3's LCD screen, it will not work while this is installed. Rename the file to ZNP_ROBIN_NANO Move the file to an empty SD Card formatted as FAT32 4096 Turn off the printer Insert the SD Card and boot the printer Step 5 - Configuration You should now be able to access Fluidd in a browser at the following address fluiddpi.local . Now you need to setup the printer.cfg . Open the \"Configuration\" tab on the left side and edit the config file. A preconfigured config file can be found online for most printers. Elegoo Neptune 3 Config by BSAS Step 6 - Calibration The printer must now be calibrated. Detailed calibration and configuration can be found in the klipper documentation Calibrate probe offset Calibrate PID Calibrate rotation distance Printing The setup should now be completed. You can now set up the printer as a physical printer in a slicer like SuperSlicer for wireless printing if desired.","title":"Klipper"},{"location":"klipper/#introduction","text":"Klipper is an open source custom firmware for 3d printers that allows for advanced printer control and customizations.
